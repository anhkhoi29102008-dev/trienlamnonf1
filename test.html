                Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born January 7, 1985) is a British racing driver widely considered
                one of the greatest Formula 1 competitors. He debuted in F1 with McLaren in 2007, won his first
                championship in 2008, and later joined Mercedes where he secured multiple world titles. Off-track,
                Hamilton is notable for his activism on diversity, sustainability, and social justice, and for his
                influence in fashion and culture.
